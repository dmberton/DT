# DrawingTool

Please install npm if not already installed on your local machine.
Navigate to the base of the project directory [...]/drawing-tool where the file `package.json` resides.

Execute the command `npm install` in that directory. All dependencies should download. You can ignore warnings.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can now upload an input file and then click generate to obtain an output file. The content of the file is also displayed on the webpage.

The sources are located under the src directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Thanks.

Dominique Berton.
